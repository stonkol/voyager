# Voyager Mission Planning Notes

- *Date: Early 1970s*
- *Project: Mariner Jupiter/Saturn 1977 (later renamed Voyager)*
- *Prepared by: Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)*

---

## 1. Mission Objective
- Launch two spacecraft to conduct flybys of Jupiter and Saturn.
- Perform detailed scientific investigations of planetary atmospheres, satellites, rings, and magnetospheres.
- Use gravity assist maneuvers to extend mission to Uranus and Neptune if possible.
- Collect data to enhance understanding of outer planets and the solar system.

---

## 2. Mission Timeline
- **Launch Window:** August-September 1977 (approximately one-month launch period).
- **Jupiter Arrival:** March – July 1979.
- **Saturn Arrival:** November 1980 – August 1981.
- **Extended Mission:** Potential Uranus encounter in 1986 and Neptune thereafter, contingent on trajectory and spacecraft health.

## 3. Spacecraft Configuration
- Dual spacecraft design (Voyager 1 and Voyager 2).
- Redundant computer command subsystems for reliability.
- Equipped with scientific instruments: imaging systems, magnetometers, plasma detectors, cosmic ray detectors, infrared and ultraviolet spectrometers.
- Power supplied by Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators (RTGs).
- Communication via Deep Space Network.

---

## 4. Trajectory and Navigation
- Employ gravity-assist technique at Jupiter to reduce fuel requirements and increase velocity for Saturn encounter.
- Precise trajectory corrections planned during cruise phases.
- Continuous monitoring and command uplink via CCS (Command Computer Subsystem).
- Contingency plans for trajectory adjustments to optimize scientific return or respond to anomalies.

---

## 5. Project Management and Operations
- Managed by Jet Propulsion Laboratory under NASA contract.
- Development phases include design, manufacturing, testing, and integration.
- Security protocols for handling nuclear materials (RTGs) outlined.
- Coordination with Deep Space Network for tracking and data reception.
- Extensive documentation and meeting minutes maintained for project control.

---

## 6. Risk and Contingency Planning
- Proof-Test Model spacecraft fabricated for backup and testing.
- Launch delays and mission extension scenarios considered.
- Redundancy in critical systems to mitigate hardware failures.
- Plans for possible use of Space Shuttle for backup spacecraft launch (conceptual).

---

## 7. Scientific Goals
- Study Jupiter’s atmosphere, moons (especially Io), magnetic field, and radiation belts.
- Investigate Saturn’s rings, Titan’s atmosphere, and magnetosphere.
- Collect data on solar wind and interplanetary medium en route.
- Provide groundwork for future outer planet exploration missions.
